Humble Bundle is a website that allows you to pay what you want for digital copies of books and games. A portion of every order is donated to charity.

Last week, I purchased my first Humble Bundle when I decided to purchase $625 worth of O'Reilly media web design and development books for $15!



Pro-tip: You can decide how much of your purchase is donated and how much is directed to Humble Bundle versus the publisher.

Oh, and here's a great quote from this Wikipedia ondd
[salted duck eggs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_duck_degg).

> A salted duck egg is a Chinese preserved food product made by soaking duck
> eggs in brine, or packing each egg in damp, salted charcoal. In Asian
> supermarkets, these eggs are sometimes sold covered in a thick layer of salted
> charcoal paste. The eggs may also be sold with the salted paste removed,
> wrapped in plastic, and vacuum packed. From the salt curing process, the
> salted duck eggs have a briny aroma, a gelatin-like egg white and a
> firm-textured, round yolk that is bright orange-red in color.

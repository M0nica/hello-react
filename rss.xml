I was able to grab a copy for a $1 last week via a recent deal on Humble Bundle. The book starts off with an intro/refresher on how JavaScript has changed in ECMAScript 6 (ES6) and throughout the books explains Functional Web Development with React and Redux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.humblebundle.com/&quot;&gt;Humble Bundle&lt;/a&gt; is a website that offers steep discounts and allows you to ‚Äúpay-what-you-want‚Äù for digital copies of books and games. A portion of every purchase is donated to charity. Pro-tip: You can decide how much of your purchase is donated as well as how much is directed to Humble Bundle versus the publisher. I appreciate that Humble Bundle is transparent about where my purchase will be allocated and also takes it a step further by allowing me to change how my purchase is divvied up if I choose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- Oh, and here&apos;s a great quote from this Wikipedia ondd
[salted duck eggs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_duck_degg).

&gt; A salted duck egg is a Chinese preserved food product made by soaking duck
&gt; eggs in brine, or packing each egg in damp, salted charcoal. In Asian
&gt; supermarkets, these eggs are sometimes sold covered in a thick layer of salted
&gt; charcoal paste. The eggs may also be sold with the salted paste removed,
&gt; wrapped in plastic, and vacuum packed. From the salt curing process, the
&gt; salted duck eggs have a briny aroma, a gelatin-like egg white and a
&gt; firm-textured, round yolk that is bright orange-red in color.

&lt;p&gt;Did you know that ‚Äúdespite its name, salted duck eggs can also be made from
chicken eggs, though the taste and texture will be somewhat different, and the
egg yolk will be less rich.‚Äù?
(&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_duck_egg&quot;&gt;Wikipedia Link&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I didn‚Äôt either.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[New Beginnings]]></title><description><![CDATA[Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and

Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;On deer horse aboard tritely yikes and much&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad
Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text
didn‚Äôt listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and
made herself on the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This however showed weasel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well uncritical so misled&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this is very interesting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Goodness much until that fluid owl&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she reached the first hills of the &lt;strong&gt;Italic Mountains&lt;/strong&gt;, she had a last

&lt;a href=&quot;http://google.com&quot;&gt;Alphabet Village&lt;/a&gt; and the subline of her own road, the Line
Lane. Pityful a rethoric question ran over her cheek, then she continued her
way. On her way she met a copy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Overlaid the jeepers uselessly much excluding&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn‚Äôt take long until a
few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk with
&lt;a href=&quot;http://google.com&quot;&gt;Longe and Parole&lt;/a&gt; and dragged her into their agency, where
they abused her for their projects again and again. And if she hasn‚Äôt been
rewritten, then they are still using her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your
mouth. Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is
an almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the
name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The copy warned the Little Blind Text, that where it came from it would have
been rewritten a thousand times and everything that was left from its origin
would be the word ‚Äúand‚Äù and the Little Blind Text should turn around and
